<p>This GitHub public repository ( <a href="https://github.com/oasis-open/dita-rng-converter">https://github.com/oasis-open/dita-rng-converter</a> ) was created at the request of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/dita/">OASIS Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) TC</a> as an <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/">OASIS Open Repository</a> to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.</p>

<p>While this Open Repository remains associated with the sponsor TC, its development priorities, leadership, intellectual property terms, participation rules, and other matters of governance are <a href="https://github.com/oasis-open/dita-rng-converter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#governance-distinct-from-oasis-tc-process">separate and distinct</a> from the OASIS TC Process and related policies.</p>

<h2><a id="purposeStatement">Statement of Purpose</a></h2>

<p>Statement of Purpose for this OASIS Open Repository (dita-rng-converter) as <a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/dita/201601/msg00040.html">proposed</a> and <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/57596/minutes20160223.txt">approved</a> by the TC:</p>

<p>The repository manages the source code and supporting documentation for the RELAX NG-to-DTD and RELAX NG-to-XSD (and any other RNG-to-X transforms that might be developed, such as RELAX NG-to-EDD or RELAX NG-to-Schematron) transforms developed originally for use by the DITA TC in producing the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita/v1.3/">DITA 1.3</a> DTDs and XSDs from the normative RELAX NG versions of the DITA 1.3 grammar. The converter is intended to make it easy for any DITA user to develop and maintain their own document type shells, constraint modules, and vocabulary modules using RELAX NG, which has proven to be much easier to use than DTD or XSD.</p>
