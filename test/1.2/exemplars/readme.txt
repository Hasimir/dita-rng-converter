Contains the original versions of the DITA 1.2 DTD and
XSD files, modified only where the exemplar and generated
files differ in non-important ways, such as white space
or order of order-independent declarations or tokens.

These exemplars are used for regression testing of the
transforms against the DITA 1.2 baseline RNG grammars
to ensure that the transforms are correct.

This testing is by both manual inspection and automated
line-by-line comparison (e.g., using OxygenXML's 
directory compare tool).
